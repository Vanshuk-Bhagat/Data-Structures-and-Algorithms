# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

This repository contains basic implementations of essential data structures and algorithms, focusing on arrays, searching techniques, linked lists, queues, stacks, and sorting algorithms. The code in this repository is organized to help beginners and intermediate developers understand and implement these fundamental concepts.

Folder Contents:

1. Arrays:
   - This folder contains examples and implementations of arrays, demonstrating various operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.
   
2. Linear and Binary Search:
   - Linear Search: A straightforward search algorithm that checks each element in an array until it finds the target.
   - Binary Search: An efficient search algorithm that works on sorted arrays by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

3. Linked Lists:
   - Implementations of singly and doubly linked lists, showcasing how nodes are connected, inserted, and deleted in a linked list structure.
   
4. Queues:
   - Queue implementations, demonstrating both **FIFO (First In First Out)** behavior. Includes examples of standard queues and circular queues.
   
5. Stacks:
   - Stack implementations using both arrays and linked lists. The stack follows **LIFO (Last In First Out)** behavior, with operations like push, pop, and peek.
   
6. Sorting Algorithms:
   - A collection of sorting algorithm implementations, including:
       Quick Sort
       Merge Sort
       Bubble Sort
       Insertion Sort
   - Each algorithm is written with detailed steps to help users understand the sorting process.

Technologies Used:
Language: Python.
Tools: Implementations using standard data structures and algorithmic logic, suitable for both learning and practical applications.

Purpose:
This repository is aimed at helping individuals learn and practice data structures and algorithms through practical examples. The content is useful for:
- Students studying computer science.
- Developers preparing for technical interviews.
- Anyone interested in mastering core data structures and algorithms.

Feel free to explore the code, use it as a reference for your own learning, or contribute to further improvements!
